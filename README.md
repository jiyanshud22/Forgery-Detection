# Image-Forgery-Detection-using-ELA-
• Developed a Python Script for passive image forgery detection using the Error Level Analysis(ELA) algorithm.
<br>
• Reviewed the research paper titled Passive Image Forgery Detection Based on the Demosaicing Algorithm and JPEG
<br>
Compression’ published by IEEE and learnt about various forgery detection techniques such as ELA and CFA.
<br>
• Implemented the Error Level Analysis Detection Technique for the purpose of detecting digitally forged and morphed images.
<br>
• Successfully detected fake X-ray images, medical reports, documents and morphed images, thereby exploring Cyber-Security.
